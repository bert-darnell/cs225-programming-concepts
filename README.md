# CS225 Programming Concepts

This repository contains the project related assignments for a C++ programing class I took at Park University in Parkville, MO. It begins with basic structures and input/output files, then movies into functions, arrays, strings, structures, pointers, overloading, dynamic data, and finally inheritance and polymorphism.
